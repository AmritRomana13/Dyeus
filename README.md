I didn't view the complete codebase, I just saw this assignment 20 minutes before and I am sharing the code upto my understanding.I have mentioned the comments between the code segments, please refer to that

Import the Dashboard.js for using it as a root component :

import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Dashboard />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
